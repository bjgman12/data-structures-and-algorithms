# Trees
 > implementation of binary tree data structure

 ## challenge
 > write a BT with pree post and inorder traversal methods then write BST with an add and contains method
 ## Efficiency
 efficiency for searcing binary tree should be o(log(n))


 ## Find MAx Value

 ## challenge
  write a function that will find the maximun value in a binary tree

  ## approach 
  > i used pre order traversal to find the maximum value
