# Hashtables
> This is my implementation of the data structure of hashtables

## Chalenge
> implement a hashtable and test its functionality as such

## approach and efficiency
> in this implementation i implement a hash table by combining 3 different data structures an array a tuple and a linked list , these together give me what i need to create the hashtable

> simple hashing algorithm used as well as  set contains and get methods 

> for hash tables the bigO for insert lookop and delete are on average O(1) and at worst case O(n)

## API
get method takes in a requested key and will return the value if it finds it else it will return false

set method take in a key and a value and adds it to the hastable

contains runs get with a requested key and returns a boolean if the key is in the table.
